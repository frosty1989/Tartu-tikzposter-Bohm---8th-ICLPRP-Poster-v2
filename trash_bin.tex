    \section*{Residual stress measurement}
    The residual stress measurements were carried out using the incremental centre hole-drilling (ICHD) technique and X-ray diffraction using conventional X-ray diffraction \(\sin ^2(\Psi )\) technique. The hole drilling system PRISM by Stresstech company was used to gain depth-resolved residual stress profiles. A Rigaku XRD Automate 2 instrument and electrolytic removal was used for analyzing residual stresses in two orthogonal directions. XRD residual stress measurement parameters are provided in Table~2.

    The residual stress measurements were carried out using the hole drilling technique  and X-ray diffraction (XRD) using conventional X-ray diffraction \(\sin ^2(\Psi )\) technique. The hole drilling system PRISM by Stresstech company was used to gain depth-resolved residual stress profiles. The hole drilling method is based on the measurements of surface distortion caused by the drilling using electronic speckle pattern interferometry. The drill diameter was 3.2 mm, and it enabled measurements to 1.9 mm in depth.  A Rigaku XRD Automate 2 instrument and electrolytic removal was used for analyzing residual stresses in two orthogonal directions. XRD residual stress measurement parameters are provided in Table~2.
