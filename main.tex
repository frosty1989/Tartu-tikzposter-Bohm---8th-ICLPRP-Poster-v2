    % ABSTRACT
    
\block{Abstract}{
    Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring is a non-destructive evaluation technique widely used to detect and analyse the acoustic waves generated by material deformation and damage. In this study, we applied AE monitoring to laser shock peening (LSP). LSP treatment technique uses a high-intensity laser beam to generate a shock wave that induces compressive residual stresses in metallic materials. We conducted LSP experiments on alloy samples and simultaneously recorded the AE signals generated during the process. The AE signals were analysed to identify the different types of acoustic events and their corresponding sources, including breakdown in water and dielectric breakdown within the laser beam in the air. The results show that AE monitoring can provide valuable information on the LSP process and its effects on the material properties. Furthermore, the AE signals can be used to optimize the LSP parameters, such as the laser energy and spot size, to achieve the desired compressive residual stresses and avoid undesired damage. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of AE monitoring as a powerful tool for the in-situ characterization of LSP, providing insights into the underlying physical processes and helping to improve the quality and reliability of the treated materials.

    % SAMPLE MATERIAL

    \section*{Sample material}
    Aluminium AA2024 was machined into dimensions of \(\SI[]{100}{} \times \SI[]{100}{} \times \SI[]{5}{}\) \SI[]{}{\mm}. The surface roughness of the material was \( R_a  = \SI[]{0.754}{\micro\metre} \). The surface was not polished.  The surface residual stress baseline level measured by X-ray diffraction was  \( \SI[]{}{\sigma}  = \SI[separate-uncertainty = true]{8.15 \pm 7.80 }{\mega\pascal} \).

    % LASER SYSTEM

    \section*{Laser system}
    A Litron LPY ST 7875-10 2HG laser was used for peening the samples. The Litron laser is a pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a oscillator-amplifier configuration with stable resonators. The system generates pulses tens of nanoseconds in duration at \SI{532}{\nano\meter} (or \SI{1064}{\nano\meter}) with a pulse energy up to \SI{1.5}{\joule }(@\SI{532}{\nano\meter}) at \SI{10}{\hertz} repetition rate. The critical parameters of this system are summarized in Table~1~\cite{litron}. The temporal shape of the Litron laser pulse was measured by an InGaAs EOT ET-3000EXT PIN detector, recorded by a Rohde\&Schwarz RTA4004 Digital Oscilloscope and the profile of the laser pulse at \SI{36}{\milli\joule} recorded by an Allied Vision Manta G-210B ASG GigE near field camera are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profile}. 
    The FWHM of the laser pulse is \SI{18.6}{\ns}.

    % EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

    \section*{Experimental setup}
    The optical setup is shown in Figure \ref{fig:optical_setup}. The process was performed at \SI{532}{\nano\meter} with samples submerged into water. The laser beam passes through a Faraday isolator, a vacuumed telescope and is redirected by dual band laser mirrors with anti-reflective coating. The setup is accompanied with diagnostics - energy meter, near field and far field camera, and photodiode. The beam is focused onto the sample using a plano-convex lens with 300 mm focal length mounted on one side of a acrylic tank. The sample was positioned using a FANUC~M-20iB/35B 6-axis industrial robotic arm and   submerged into tap water at a temperature of \SI{18}{\celsius}.
    The acoustic signal emitted during the LSP process is recorded by a Xarion Eta250 Ultra optical microphone.

    % OPTICAL MICROPHONE
    
    \section*{Optical microphone}

     An optical microphone (Xarion Eta250 Ultra) was placed in a constant distance to the sample to record the acoustic signals reflected from the surface of the sample during the pulse impacts. An optical microphone consists of a miniaturized Fabry-Pérot laser interferometer (FPI) and is directly measuring the changes in the density of the optical medium.  The microphone has a sensitivity of \SI[]{10}{\milli\volt/\pascal} @ \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}, frequency range of \SI{10}{\hertz} - \SI{1}{\mega\hertz}, an output impedance of \SI{50}{\Omega} and an omnidirectional polar pattern. The output was connected to an oscilloscope (Picoscope 5444B) for obtaining the temporal evolution of the LSP acoustic signal at a sample rate of \SI[]{62.5}{\mega\siemens/\s}.

    % RESIDUAL STRESS MEASUREMENT

    \section*{Residual stress measurement}
    The residual stress measurements were carried out using the hole drilling technique. The hole drilling system PRISM by Stresstech company was used to gain depth-resolved residual stress profiles. The hole drilling method is based on the measurements of surface distortion caused by the drilling using electronic speckle pattern interferometry. The drill diameter was 3.2 mm, and enabled measurements to 1.9 mm in depth.

    \section*{LSP processing parameters}

    The samples were LSP processed with parameters listed in Table~3. No sacrificial layer was laid on the surface during LSP processing. A  pattern of overlapping (50\%) pulse impacts was created. The pattern creation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:optical_setup}.

    % BREAKDOWN IN WATER
    
    \subsection*{Laser-induced breakdown in water}
    As shown in Table~3, two set of LSP processing parameters were chosen, differing only in the distance from the focusing lens. In the case of Patch A, the distance from the focusing lens was chosen before the occurrence of laser-induced breakdown in water. In contrast, Patch B was intentionally peened with a laser beam that initiated a breakdown in water.

    \section*{Residual stress}
    The acoustic signals from Patch B were averaged and a mask with X offset \SI[]{200}{\micro\second} and Y offset \SI[]{1}{\milli\volt} was created. This mask was then overlaid on top of the averaged acoustic signal from Patch A. In Figure, we can see there is a clear difference between the Patch A acoustic signal average (before breakdown) and Patch A acoustic signal average (after breakdown).
