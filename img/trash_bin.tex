    \section*{Residual stress measurement}
    The residual stress measurements were carried out using the incremental centre hole-drilling (ICHD) technique and X-ray diffraction using conventional X-ray diffraction \(\sin ^2(\Psi )\) technique. The hole drilling system PRISM by Stresstech company was used to gain depth-resolved residual stress profiles. A Rigaku XRD Automate 2 instrument and electrolytic removal was used for analyzing residual stresses in two orthogonal directions. XRD residual stress measurement parameters are provided in Table.
